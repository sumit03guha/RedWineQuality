# RedWineQuality
A machine learning model to predict the quality of red wine.

For the purpose of predicting and classifying the quality of red wine I have implented a machine learning model that uses **XGBoost** method.
The code has been well commented in details for the ease of reading and understanding the implementational approaches including the exploratory data analysis, data visualiztion, data pre-processing and the data modelling.
